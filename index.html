</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> Project Abstract: Falls cause many life threatening injuries among the elderly such as bone fractures and spinal cord injuries. In many circumstances, these mishaps decide either life or death for an individual. With technology permeating into every household, programs such as virtual home-based exercises are leveraged by the elderly population to stay physically fit. However, every elderly persons&rsquo; body condition differ from each other and, thus, a single exercise program conducted in a group setting increases the potential of a fall for individuals who become fatigued quicker than others. Armed with previous research studies indicating that falls are common during these exercises, in this work we develop a system that detects falls during home-based exercises using Deep Learning models. These models are applied over videos captured by webcams, smartphones, and the like, wherein they extract the skeleton joint co-ordinates of the individual and by using our 3 rules, can detect falls if they occur. Evaluating our system on impersonated falls reveal that our approach can accurately detect a fall. The novelty of our approach as compared to other existing approaches is that it is cost-effective and works upon video capture technology the elderly are already familiar with. This project is under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/index.html"> Wenyao Xu</a> and advised by <a href="https://jerryajay.com/"> Jerry Ajay</a>.</p>

<p><li> Role: Lead Software Developer &amp; Researcher.
<li> Built a tool to extract human body key points from video surveillance using a deep learning technology.
<li> Designed a deep learning model in Python to identify and to distinguish fall motion from other human activities with 95% of the positive fall detection rate.
<li> Evaluated and optimized the model to significantly increase the efficiency of fall detection to compute in real-time by reducing the system’s complexity.
<li> Presented the Fall Detection project and the significant of human skeleton extraction method to the public during the Computer Science Education Week at the University at Buffalo.

<li> Project Abstract: The ill-fitting shoes can cause many health implications, ranging from feet ache to feet sore, from back injury to back pain and so on. Due to the manufacturing variance and design consideration, shoes from different brands will vary in size and shape. Good-fit insoles and shoes are necessary to prevent users from ill-fitting problems. Hence, we propose a novel technique that can be used to calculate parameters of the foot using a smart phone RGB camera. Typically, we focus on estimating six main parameters of the foot, including foot length, foot width, foot back height, toe height, heel circumference and foot circumference. These six parameters will significantly help users to find the right shoes or order a tailor-made insoles that fits their foot condition so that they can sustain their foot health and avoid further damage. Since each parameter is unique in its nature, we apply independent mathematical formulas accordingly and design effectively algorithms to estimate them respectively.</p>

<p><li> Role: Software Developer &amp; Researcher.
<li> Utilized computer vision technology in Python to analyze human foot parameters including foot length, foot width, foot circumference, heel circumference, toe height, and foot back height.

<li> Visualized and evaluated human foots’ computed data, and optimized the algorithms to reduce error rates.

Hi there, this is Darasy.</p>

<p>I am currently a Computer Systems Engineering graduate student at Northeastern University (Graduating May 2021). I graduated in both Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from SUNY, University at Buffalo.</p>

<p>I was a Machine Learning Engineer Co-op at Bose Corporation (Health). In this role, I researched the early stages of battery life estimation research to build an Open Circuit Voltage-based model using State-of-Charge. I have also designed a promising method to detect sleep onset based on personalizing parameters. Besides, I was responsible for implementing a therapy metric module in Python for measuring breathe adherence of the individual and evaluating a therapy generative content across the testing session. I also quantified synchrony between respiration waveform and guided breathing sounds to evaluate how well a person follows the sounds.</p>

<p>I was a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Diversiteam. In this role, I built machine learning models such as Bi-LSTM and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for resume parsing using Python and technologies such as OCR, OpenCV, and Tensorflow. Beyond this project, I researched and collected data for good candidate identification where I analyzed the data spread for each feature and studied the importance of features.</p>

<p>I was a member of the Embedded Sensing and Computing Lab, where I had worked on a project using deep learning to recognize a fall accident during home-based exercises. I implemented algorithms coding in Python to analyze human motions&rsquo; data to estimate human pose and to detect a fall. For another project, I explored a smartphone-based solution to foot shape analysis where I developed the program in Python.</p>

<p>I had also worked on an activity recognition project under an Engineering Intramural project. I designed and optimized machine learning models including CNNs, and Random Forest to characterize the movements of a patient. I implemented these unsupervised and supervised machine learning models using Python and TensorFlow.</p>

<p>Generally, I am an experienced machine learning and software engineer with an understanding of software development, algorithms, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic studies, I have gained skills proficiently in programming languages such as Python and Java as well as object-oriented design, algorithm analysis, data analysis, and machine learning model design.</p>
