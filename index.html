Characterizing patient&rsquo;s can provide significant information to nurses  and relevant staff especially when immediate assistances are needed in the events of patient fall, patient stroke and etc. In this project, in collaboartion between UB and Curbell Medical, we researched on the approach using Machine Learning models to characterize unusual patient&rsquo;s movements such as sitting and standing. In addition, since patients cannot move fluently like normal healthy people, we  used Arduino to collect our own human activity dataset that can be applied in real hospital situation.

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<p>
Falls cause many life threatening injuries among the elderly such as bone fractures and spinal cord injuries. In many circumstances, these mishaps decide either life or death for an individual. With technology permeating into every household, programs such as virtual home-based exercises are leveraged by the elderly population to stay physically fit. However, every elderly persons&rsquo; body condition differ from each other and, thus, a single exercise program conducted in a group setting increases the potential of a fall for individuals who become fatigued quicker than others. Armed with previous research studies indicating that falls are common during these exercises, in this work we develop a system that detects falls during home-based exercises using Deep Learning models. These models are applied over videos captured by webcams, smartphones, and the like, wherein they extract the skeleton joint co-ordinates of the individual and by using our 3 rules, can detect falls if they occur. Evaluating our system on impersonated falls reveal that our approach can accurately detect a fall. The novelty of our approach as compared to other existing approaches is that it is cost-effective and works upon video capture technology the elderly are already familiar with. This project is under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/index.html"> Wenyao Xu</a> and advised by <a href="https://jerryajay.com/"> Jerry Ajay</a>.

<div>
<ul>
<p>
The ill-fitting shoes can cause many health implications, ranging from feet ache to feet sore, from back injury to back pain and so on. Due to the manufacturing variance and design consideration, shoes from different brands will vary in size and shape. Good-fit insoles and shoes are necessary to prevent users from ill-fitting problems. Hence, we propose a novel technique that can be used to calculate parameters of the foot using a smart phone RGB camera. Typically, we focus on estimating six main parameters of the foot, including foot length, foot width, foot back height, toe height, heel circumference and foot circumference. These six parameters will significantly help users to find the right shoes or order a tailor-made insoles that fits their foot condition so that they can sustain their foot health and avoid further damage. Since each parameter is unique in its nature, we apply independent mathematical formulas accordingly and design effectively algorithms to estimate them respectively.

Crime Hunter is a 2D arcade car game. You play as the police and your goal is to shoot down all the enemy vehicles before you reach the end of the map. While you are chasing them down you have to avoid potholes, bullets fired from the enemy and other vehicles on the road. Just like in real life, the other vehicles on the road will try their best to get out of your way as you speed past.

Hi there! I am Darasy, a Computer Systems Engineering - IoT graduate student and an experienced software developer from Northeastern University (NU), Boston, MA. I graduated in B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics at SUNY, University at Buffalo (UB) in 2018. During my undergraduate studies at UB, I was an undergraduate research assistant at the Embedded Sensing and Computing (ESC) Lab within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering where I did research projects under the direction of Dr. Wenyao XU and Mr. Jerry Ajay. My interest in doing research projects fall primarily into smart healthcare and cybersecurity applications. In computer science field, generally, I have a greatest passion in the field of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligent. I wish to apply my data science knowledge into analyzing the big complex data to find the resolutions to the smart healthcare problems.</p>
